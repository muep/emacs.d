This is my personal configuration for GNU Emacs. While it does not
attempt to be very useful for any other users, it is convenient to
have it in an easily accessible location.

Apart from files which have been marked to be available under some
other license, you are free to use, copy, modify and distribute the
configuration in parts or as a whole.
